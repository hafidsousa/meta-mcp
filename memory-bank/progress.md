## Recent Progress

- Implemented humps library for reliable camelCase to snake_case conversion
  - Added to all operation modules (adset.ts, ad.ts, campaign.ts)
  - Simplified code by removing manual case conversion
  - Improved handling of complex nested objects in API parameters
  - Added clear documentation about required camelCase format
  - Fixed issues with targeting parameter handling
- Completed major code refactoring with modular architecture
- Split monolithic client.ts (1179 lines) into domain-specific modules
- Modularized server.ts into smaller focused files:
  - Extracted configuration and logging to config.ts
  - Moved tool definitions to tools.ts
  - Separated request handlers to handlers.ts
  - Simplified main server.ts to focus on server setup
- Implemented facade pattern in client.ts class
- Created utils/api.ts for centralized API request handling
- Separated operations by domain (campaign, adset, ad, account)
- Updated all imports and exports to reflect new structure
- Each module now under 300 lines for maintainability
- Standardized function signatures across modules
- Consistent parameter ordering (baseUrl, adAccountId, accessToken, etc.)
- Updated exports in index.ts to include all new modules
- Enhanced AdSet creation with proper targeting object serialization
- Standardized MCP tool schemas with comprehensive documentation:
  - Updated ADSET_TOOL schema with detailed parameter descriptions
  - Added proper type information, enums, and validation
  - Structured complex nested objects with complete documentation
  - Established schema standards for all future tool development

## Next Milestone Goals

1. Update tests for new modular architecture
2. Update remaining tool schemas to follow new standards
3. Complete test coverage for all core functionality
4. Implement remaining campaign management tools
